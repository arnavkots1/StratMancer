      "notes": "WR 63.3% and PR 7.6% confirms massive power spike, driving a critical BR of 14.5%. This shift indicates Malphite received significant scaling buffs (likely to AP ratios or base damage) making him a one-shot threat, or his tank itemization became overwhelmingly potent. His near-uncontestable ultimate makes him the primary high-priority ban; failure to ban results in guaranteed team fight domination. Favors compositions needing instantaneous engage."

      "notes": "Achieving 64.8% WR alongside high PR (7.5%) and BR (9.8%) demonstrates systemic dominance. This spike suggests items crucial for his scaling (Crit/Lethality) are highly efficient, or map/vision changes favor his Q (Ambush) utility. Twitch's capacity to surprise-gank lanes and transition into a late-game AOE monster is defining the current pacing, forcing teams to invest heavily in deep vision control."

      "notes": "Extreme 71.4% WR indicates a niche but potentially overpowered interaction, likely a direct buff to her early game damage or Rend (E) scaling. While PR is low (0.6%), showing the player base is slowly adapting, she is a game-breaking champion in the hands of specialists. Strategic implication: she dominates the laning phase entirely and shuts down traditional scaling ADCs."

      "notes": "High WR (60.0%) suggests the current meta prioritizes early jungle pressure and successful ganking. Rek'Sai's natural strength lies in rapid map traversal and guaranteed knock-ups. Potential buffs to her base damage or tunnel cooldowns allow her to secure early leads easily, transitioning into an unstoppable mid-game diver. Weakness in late-game scaling is currently negated by overwhelming early tempo."

      "notes": "Highest PR (10.8%) indicates Nami is the preferred supportive choice, offering safe laning and effective enabling for dominant ADCs (Twitch, Samira). Her 54.3% WR is solid, signifying reliability rather than outright dominance. She acts as a stability anchor in a volatile meta, providing necessary sustain and pick potential via her ultimate (R)."

As a marksman jungler, their ability to transition damage into the late game is highly valued. The ultimate (R) provides crucial clutch survivability in objective fights, proving highly impactful in a burst-heavy meta."
